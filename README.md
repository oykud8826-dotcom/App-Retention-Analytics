# #  Mobile App User Retention & Cohort Analysis

> **Domain:** Product Analytics / Growth | **Metric:** Retention Rate, Churn, CLV

##  Project Overview
In the subscription-based economy, acquiring users is silver, but retaining them is gold. This project focuses on **Cohort Analysis**, a gold-standard technique used by Product Managers to track user engagement over time.

Using Python, I simulated a dataset for a hypothetical mobile app (e.g., a Language Learning or Fitness App) to analyze **Customer Churn** and visualize **Retention Heatmaps**.

##  Key Objectives
- **Cohort Analysis:** Grouping users by their sign-up month to track how long they stay active.
- **Churn Calculation:** Identifying the drop-off points in the user lifecycle (e.g., Do they leave after the free trial?).
- **Data Visualization:** Creating an intuitive **Retention Heatmap** using Seaborn to communicate insights to stakeholders.

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas:** Advanced data manipulation (Pivot tables, DateTime indexing).
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib:** Heatmap visualization.
- **NumPy:** Synthetic data generation for subscription metrics.

## Sample Insight
*From the analysis:*
- Users acquired in **Q4 (Marketing Campaign period)** showed a **15% higher retention rate** in Month 3 compared to Q2 users, suggesting better product-market fit or higher quality leads during that period.
